# 🧩 Phase 1: Planning & Direction – Professional Cheat Sheet

---

## 🔄 Where it Fits in the Intelligence Cycle

1. 📌 **Planning & Direction** — *YOU ARE HERE* — Define IRs and prioritize.
2. 📥 **Collection** — Gather data based on IRs.
3. 🧠 **Processing & Analysis** — Make sense of the raw input.
4. 📤 **Dissemination** — Deliver intelligence to stakeholders.

---

## 🎯 Objective
Establish clear, prioritized intelligence requirements aligned with organizational goals to guide efficient and effective intelligence operation.

## 🛠️ Core Components

### 1. Identify Intelligence Requirements (IRs)

- **Engage Stakeholders*: Consult with decision-makers to understand their information nees.
- **Formulate Specific Questions*: Develop clear, concise questions that the intelligence should answr.
- **Prioritize IRs*: Assess the urgency and importance of each requirement to allocate resources effectivey.

> 💬 Ask the decision-maker:
- “What decision are you trying to make?”
- “What risk are you trying to reduce?”
- “When is the deadline?”

📌 *Write it down. Confirm in plain language.*

---

### 🧠 2. Analyze the Task (Task Analysis)  
**Goal:** Define the context, limitations, and required output.

> 🛠 Do this:
- Sketch a quick **situation overview**
- List **knowns vs unknowns**
- Identify **constraints** (time, legality, access)
- Determine desired **format** of the product (brief, report, alert, etc.)

🗓 *Set the timeline for delivery now.*

### 🔮 3. Build Hypotheses  
**Goal:** Create focused assumptions to explore.

> ✍️ Example format:
- **“We believe [X] is happening because of [Y] which may result in [Z].”**

🎯 Keep 2–3 working hypotheses – not 10.

---

### 📍 4. Define Indicators  
**Goal:** Pinpoint what evidence would prove or disprove each hypothesis.

> 🔍 Ask:
- “What would I expect to see if this hypothesis is true?”
- “What activity, behavior, or signal could confirm or reject it?”

🧪 Make them **observable, specific, measurable**.

---

### ❓ 5. Break Down Info Requirements  
**Goal:** Translate the decision-maker’s need into structured questions.

> 🎯 Breakdown:
- **Primary IR:** The main decision-support question
- **Level 1 IRs:** Sub-questions for analysis
- **Level 2 IRs:** Specific yes/no or factual questions

📋 *Each IR should tie to an indicator or hypothesis.*

---

### 📡 6. Build the Collection Plan  
**Goal:** Decide *how, where, and by whom* each info need will be answered.

> ✅ Map this:
| Info Need | Method | Source/Asset | Deadline |
|-----------|--------|--------------|----------|
| “Who is financing the network?” | HUMINT + FININT | Trusted source + FIU | Friday 12:00 |

💡 Only assign methods you have access to and control over.

## 🚦 Decision Gate

Before launching into collection:
✅ IRs defined  
✅ Hypotheses + Indicators ready  
✅ Collection mapped  
✅ Timeline set  
✅ Decision-maker signed off

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

- 🔄 Vague requirements = useless products  
- 🗃 Too much info = no focus  
- 📆 Missed timing = irrelevant results  
- 🎯 Ignoring original decision need = off-target product

## 🛠 Templates (Quick Reuse)

### 🎯 IR Template
```
The decision-maker needs to decide on [X].
To do that, we need to know [IR].
IR can be answered by collecting [Indicators] from [Sources].
```

### 📍 Indicator Template
```
Hypothesis: [X]
Indicator 1: [Specific behavior or signal]
Indicator 2: [Observable pattern or data point]
```
