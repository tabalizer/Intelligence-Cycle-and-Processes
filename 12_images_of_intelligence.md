## 📖 How to Apply  
1. **Pick Your Image:** Choose the lens that fits your phase (Truth for fact-gathering, Service for delivery).  
2. **Balance It:** Always pair with a contrasting Image (e.g., Intuition + Falsification).  
3. **Rotate & Refresh:** Switch primary Images at each milestone or briefing.  
4. **Layer & Blend:** Combine 2–3 Images in deliverables (e.g., an AI model [Elucidation] + practitioner insights [Experience] + power-context overlay [Power]).  

> **Pro Tip:** Kick off every project with a “Mirror Matrix” mapping tasks across Phenomenon, Science, Method × Subject, Product, Function, Activity to ensure full-spectrum coverage of Hatlebrekke’s Twelve Images.
